# Purpose of this project
This project's purpose is for me to experiment with Typescript in both a Node and React environment.

The target application is a simple task planner where you can log tasks that you have to do, set their priority, and then track their completion. It's intent is to be a super simplistic app, as the goal is to learn how the differences and benefits between Typescript and regular Javascript.
